The web has become bloated with unnecessary JavaScript frameworks, complex CSS, and huge images. But it doesn't have to be this way.

## Keep It Simple

A good website should:

1. **Load fast** - No multi-megabyte frameworks
2. **Be accessible** - Work for everyone, everywhere
3. **Be readable** - Clear typography and spacing
4. **Be semantic** - Use proper HTML elements

## The μ Philosophy

The μ framework embodies these principles:

- Just **1kb** of CSS
- No classes required
- Semantic HTML that just works
- Mobile-first responsive design

## Code Example

Here's how simple it can be:

```html
<article>
  <h1>My Article</h1>
  <p>Some content here.</p>
</article>
```

No frameworks, no build steps for the HTML - just clean, semantic markup.

## Conclusion

Sometimes the best solution is the simplest one. Start with good HTML, add minimal CSS, and only add complexity when absolutely necessary.
